	 * Painted data can exceed display size, in this case it will be trimmed.
	 *
	 * Matrix data is stored in two dimensional array of bytes (#data), where single bit represents one pixel.
	 * First position in #data array indicates row, second represents pixels within this row: #data[y][x]. Each byte
	 * contains 8 pixels. For example: structure consisting of 5 rows and 14 pixels per row has dimension: data[5][2] -
	 * we need two bytes per row to express 14 pixels. Also second byte of each row uses only first 6 bits -> 8 + 6 = 14

	 * Size of #data: #data[0][0] - #data[#height-1][#width/8]
	 *
	 * For example, matrix consisting of 3x2 bytes has maximal dimension 16(2*8) x 3 pixels,
	 * which gives us a 48 pixels in total. We have 3 rows, each one has two bytes.
